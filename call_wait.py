get the current time 
then use a while loop to wait 5 seconds 
use the while loop to count down each second eg 5 4 3 2 1 0 
every second print the following string  
“Your call is important to us. We don’t want to hire anyone else to answer your call, so please hold for 3 seconds” 
Do not use a wait function – use the now() function
